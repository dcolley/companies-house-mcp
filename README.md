# Companies House MCP Server

UK Companies House API integration for Model Context Protocol (MCP) - the standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources.

## Overview

This MCP server provides AI assistants with access to UK Companies House public data, enabling them to search for companies, retrieve company profiles, officer information, filing history, and more.

## Features

- 🔍 **Company Search** - Find companies by name or number
- 📊 **Company Profiles** - Detailed company information and status

- 📄 **Filing History** - Recent filings and documents
- 💰 **Charges** - Outstanding charges and mortgages
- 🏢 **PSC Data** - Persons with Significant Control
- 🔎 **Officer Search** - Find officers across companies

### Response Modes

All tools support a `verbose` parameter for detailed or compact responses:
- **Compact mode** (default): Essential information only
- **Verbose mode**: Full details including all available fields

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "companies-house": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "companies-house-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY": "${COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Running Locally with Direct Path

For local development, you can point Claude directly to your local build:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "companies-house": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/companies-house-mcp/dist/index.js", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `search_companies` | Search companies by name | `query`, `limit`, `activeOnly`, `verbose` |
| `get_company_profile` | Get detailed company info | `companyNumber`, `verbose` |
| `get_company_officers` | List company officers | `companyNumber`, `activeOnly`, `limit`, `verbose` |
| `get_filing_history` | Get filing history | `companyNumber`, `category`, `limit`, `startIndex`, `verbose` |

### Pagination

Tools that return multiple results support pagination:
- `limit`: Number of results per page (max 100)
- `startIndex`: Starting position for results

## Example Queries

Once connected to Claude, you can ask:

- "Search for companies named Tesco"
- "Get the profile for company number 00445790"
- "Who are the directors of company 00445790?"
- "Show me recent filings for company 00445790 in verbose mode"
- "Does company 00445790 have any outstanding charges?"

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Required
DEBUG=true                                 # Enable debug logging (optional)
```

### Rate Limiting

- Default: 500 requests per 5 minutes
- Automatic rate limiting prevents API quota exceeded errors
- Responses are cached to reduce API calls

## Docker Support (Optional)

A Dockerfile is included for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t companies-house-mcp .

# Run container
docker run -e COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY=your_key companies-house-mcp
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test          # Run all tests
npm run test:unit # Run unit tests only
npm run test:int  # Run integration tests
```

#### Integration Tests

Note: Integration tests require a valid Companies House API key. To run integration tests:

```bash
COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY=your_api_key npm run test:integration
```

Some tests may be skipped if:
- No Companies House API key is provided in the environment
- The runtime doesn't support the Fetch API

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint      # Check code style
npm run typecheck # Check TypeScript types
npm run format    # Format code
```

#### ESLint Configuration

This project uses ESLint v9 with the new flat configuration format. The configuration is in `eslint.config.js`.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
DEBUG=true companies-house-mcp --api-key YOUR_KEY
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid API Key"** - Verify your API key is correct and active
2. **"Rate limit exceeded"** - Wait a few minutes, the server has built-in rate limiting
3. **"Company not found"** - Check the company number format (8 characters, padded with zeros)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure:
- All tests pass (`npm test`)
- Code is properly typed (no `any` types)
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new features
